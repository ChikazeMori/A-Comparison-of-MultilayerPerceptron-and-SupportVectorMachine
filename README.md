# A Comparison of Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machine
* Applied 2 classifiers (MLP and SVM) to the heart disease dataset and compared the results.
* Tuned hyperparameters by applying a grid search with 10-fold cross validation.
* The best MLP model had an accuracy of 0.836.
* The best SVM model had an accuracy of 0.852.
